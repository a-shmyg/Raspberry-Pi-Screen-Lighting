# Raspberry-Pi-Screen-Lighting

A way for atmospheric mood lighting while gaming or surfing the net. The client Python script is run on the machine and gets the dominant color of the screen at a point in time. Then it sends the colors in RGB format to the server script running on the Raspberry Pi. The LED's wired to the Raspberry Pi take on the RGB values of the screen using PWM for brightness.
